Most recently Gartner Inc. named Ciklum as a &quot;Cool Vendor&quot; in its &quot;Cool Vendors in Application Services, 2013&quot; report.<br />Unlike the traditional project outsourcing model, we help over 200 of our clients establish their own development centers in one of our nearshore development locations where they outsource, completely or partially, their software development. This is the equivalent of having your in-house IT specialists, but for a significantly lower cost and with less administrative nuisances.<br />Ciklum clients can gain control over their IT processes and systems and get more value from the resources they already have. We surround each client team with knowledge sharing activities to foster a profitable and productive work environment during their entire outsourcing experience, including social events, strong infrastructure, financial and administrative support, Q &amp; A and Agile, Business and DevOps consulting services.</p> <p>Join Ciklum and «Cross the Borders» together with us!<br />If you are interested - please send your CV</p> <p> </p>
